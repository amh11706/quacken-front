  <h1>Map Editor Guide</h1>
  <p>The map editor allows you to create maps, tile sets, and structure sets
    which are used for automatic map generation. Anything you create here can be
    used in your own lobbies, but other people can only use them if you check
    the "Publicly Usable" option. There is currently no auto-save feature and no
    way to recover previous versions, so you must use the save button (ctrl + s)
    wisely.
  </p>

  <h4>Map Types</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Blockade Map: Maps for the Blockade lobby type.</li>
    <li>Quacken Map: Custom maps for the quacken lobby type. This map type does
      not currently support duck spawns.
    </li>
    <li>Quacken Tile Set: A set of 8x8 patterns that are used to generate maps.
    </li>
    <li>Quacken Structure Set: A set of patterns that tell the map generator
      which tile types to use and where to place them.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Importing Maps</h4>

      click to auto-complete a whirl or ctrl + click and drag for paint mode.

      click a placed obstacle to select it from the map itself. Use the mouse
      scroll wheel to scroll through the available obstacles.

    <li>Redo: Ctrl + y or the button next to the chat box.</li>
    <li>Save: Ctrl + s or the button next to the chat box.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Tile Sets</h4>
  <p>A tile set should have 2 to 8 options for each type to provide good
    variety, depending on the prominence of that particular type. You can use
    the weight option for each tile to control how common it will be relative to
    the rest of the same type. Tiles are saved individually, if it has a yellow
    color in the list, it has not been saved. Double click an existing tile name
    in the list to edit its properties. To delete a tile, set its weight to 0
    then click the X that appears next to its name. Deleting a tile cannot
    be undone and takes effect immediately when you click confirm.
  </p>

  <h4>Structure Sets</h4>
  <p>Structure sets define tile placement, obstacle placement, obstacle density,
    and duck spawn zones. Currently, obstacle zones are used to spawn the ducks
    as well, so wing zones are not used. This may change in the future if the
    need to separate them arises. Structures are saved and deleted in the same
    way as tiles. An exception to this is the individual features on a structure
    as deleting them does not take effect until you save the structure.
